# Intro to Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of specific instructions for a computer to solve a
broad class of problems.

Think about it like a recipe for making cake, where the chef follows
very specific instructions and never deviates. Computers aren't very
creative chefs that follow recipes precisely and without deviation.

## Objectives:

### Develop a basic understanding of how to think about algorithms

#### Write some basic algorithms:

* Search for an element in an array
* Sort an array with the most trivial algorithm
  * Sort an array with a slightly faster algorithm

### Understand how to describe some algorithms in terms of their Big-O notation

## In groups: Revisit an array of numbers

### Display all the elements of an array containing the elements: `2, 10, -1, 0, 200, -150`

## Let's find the index of `200` in the same array of elements

#### We'll use stickies first, and eventually progress to code.

#### What did we have to do to find the index of the element? 

## Big-O

## Let's destroy a white pages while trying to find a listing

### What is different about the white pages from the array at a fundamental level?

## Sorting

### Bubble sort

Tons-O-comparisons

O(n^2/2)

### Insertion sort
