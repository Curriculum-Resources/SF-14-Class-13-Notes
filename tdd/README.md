# Test Driven Development

## Objetives

* Understand the philosophy and the *why* of testing
* Write an app with model tests, using the tests to drive your work

## Philosophy

* :pencil: Write a test to describe and specify the code you'll write
* :broken_heart: Have the test fail
* :green_heart: Write the *minimum* amount of code to pass the test
* :repeat: Refactor your code
